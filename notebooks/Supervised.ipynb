    "There are 166 features associated with each node. Due to intellectual property issues, we cannot provide an exact description of all the features in the dataset. There is a time step associated to each node, representing a measure of the time when a transaction was broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. The time steps, running from 1 to 49, are evenly spaced with an interval of about two weeks. Each time step contains a single connected component of transactions that appeared on the blockchain within less than three hours between each other; there are no edges connecting the different time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 94 features represent local information about the transaction â€“ including the time step described above, number of inputs/outputs, transaction fee, output volume and aggregated figures such as average BTC received (spent) by the inputs/outputs and average number of incoming (outgoing) transactions associated with the inputs/outputs. The remaining 72 features are aggregated features, obtained using transaction information one-hop backward/forward from the center node - giving the maximum, minimum, standard deviation and correlation coefficients of the neighbour transactions for the same information data (number of inputs/outputs, transaction fee, etc.).\n",
